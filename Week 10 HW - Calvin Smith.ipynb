    "4. The apparent contradiction is because R-squared and p-values measure different parts of the model. A low R-squared (17.6%) indicates that the model explains only a small portion of the variation of the data, suggesting that other factors which are not in the data may influence the outcome. However, the small p-values and large confidence intervals suggest that the individual predictors included in the model have significant effects on the outcome variable. So, while the model may not take in much of the overall variability,  the specific variables we tested are still important. Overall, R-squared describes the overall model, while p-values and coefficients show the strength of the individual predictors.\n",

    "In this session, you asked for an explanation of the apparent contradiction between a low R-squared value (indicating the model explains only 17.6% of the variation in the data) and the presence of statistically significant predictors with large coefficients. You sought a simplified answer explaining how R-squared, p-values, and coefficients reflect different aspects of the model—R-squared assessing overall model fit and p-values/coefficient sizes showing the significance and impact of individual predictors. After providing an answer, you also asked if your revised explanation was clear and requested a concise summary of our discussion.\n",

    "Multicollinearity and Condition Number: We discussed multicollinearity, which occurs when predictors in a regression model are highly correlated, leading to instability in estimating each predictor's effect. We also explained the condition number, a value that indicates how severe multicollinearity is in a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Development Process (from model3_fit to model7_linear_form): We outlined how each model (model3_fit to model7_fit) builds upon the previous one:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model 5: Added predictors to capture more relationships, improving prediction accuracy.\n",
    "Model 6: Simplified by removing less important predictors, focusing only on the most significant variables.\n",
    "Model 7: Added interaction terms between key predictors and applied centering and scaling, reducing multicollinearity and improving model stability.\n",
    "Simplified Summary of Model Development: Each step balances adding important detail with simplification to achieve better predictions and stability. Centering and scaling in the final model help improve accuracy and reliability by managing multicollinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Complexity vs. Simplicity: model7_fit is a complex model with many interactions, making it perform slightly better on test data, while model6_fit is simpler, making it easier to understand and interpret.\n",
    "Generalization: model7_fit may be overfitting by picking up specific patterns in the training data that don’t generalize well to new data, whereas model6_fit tends to generalize more consistently.\n",
    "Reliability: model6_fit has stronger statistical evidence for its predictors, suggesting it produces more stable, reliable predictions.\n",
    "Overall Preference: Although model7_fit performs better in tests, model6_fit is the preferred model due to its interpretability and likelihood of making consistent predictions on new data.\n",
